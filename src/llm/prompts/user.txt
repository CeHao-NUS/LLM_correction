We observe the robot hand and objectâ€™s states, but they might have errors.

States are [x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4], where (x,y,z) are position and (q1,q2,q3,q4) are quaternion in the 3D coordinate.
The threshold of success is distance < 0.02.

You should 
(1) describe the successful state of the robot hand; 
(2) analyze the condition of final state from numerical results and image; 
(3) check whether the robot hand successfully finish the task. If the task has been successful, neglect step (4).
(4) if fails to finish the task, provide solutions to correct the failure. 

Tips to follow:
(1) Find the relative position of robot hand and object in the images.
(2) Note that the states might be inaccurate, so please analyze base on the image.
(3) Numerically analyze robot hand and object state in each step.
(4) Point out potential errors that cause the failure. For example, robot control error or observation error.
(5) Give numerical adjustment of robot hand to correct the error.
(6) Write a Python function of a trajectory compensator that make the task successful.
