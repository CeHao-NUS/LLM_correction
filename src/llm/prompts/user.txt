We observe the robot hand and objectâ€™s states, but they might have errors.

States are [x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4], where (x,y,z) are position and (q1,q2,q3,q4) are quaternion in the 3D coordinate.
The threshold of success is hand-object distance < 0.02.

You should follow the following steps:
(1) describe the successful state of the robot hand; 

(2) analyze the condition of final state from numerical results and image; 
    -(2.1) Find the relative position of robot hand and object in the images.
    -(2.2) Note that the states might be inaccurate, so please analyze base on the image. Please specify the meaning of each image.
    -(2.3) Numerically analyze robot hand and object state in each step. 

(3) check whether the robot hand successfully finish the task. If the task has been successful, neglect step (4).
    -(3.1) Calculate the distance and compare it with thresold to judge the success.
    -(3.2) Use the analysis of images in step (2) to judge if the task is successful.
    -(3.3) Report result as a dictionary in triple backtics:
    ```
        {{'success': True/False/None,}} (# where True means successful, False means unsuccessful, None means unknown. do not show content in the bracket)
    ```

(4) provide better 'change of goal' and the 'final goal' to correct the failure. 
    -(4.1) Give numerical adjustment of robot hand to correct the error.
    -(4.2) Point out potential errors that cause the failure. For example, robot control error or observation error.
    -(4.3) You can write equation to help calculate the better 'change of goal'. It should have same dimension with 'goal'.
    -(4.4) Report the result as a dictionary in triple backtics:
    ```
    {{
        'change of goal': [], (# a list that has same dimension with 'goal'. If success=Ture, report empty []. do not show content in the bracket)
    }}
    ```
