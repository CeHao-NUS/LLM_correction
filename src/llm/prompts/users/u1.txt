We observe the robot hand and objectâ€™s states, but they might have errors.

States are [x,y,z,q1,q2,q3,q4], where (x,y,z) are position and (q1,q2,q3,q4) are quaternion in the 3D coordinate.
The threshold of success is hand-object distance < 0.02.

You should follow the following steps:
(1) describe the successful state of the robot hand; 

(2) analyze the condition of final state from numerical results and image; 
    -(2.1) Find the relative position of robot hand and object in the images.
    -(2.2) Note that the states might be inaccurate, so please analyze base on the image. Please specify the meaning of each image.
    -(2.3) Numerically analyze robot hand and object state in each step.
