(4) provide better 'change of goal' and the 'final goal' to correct the failure. 
    -(4.1) Give numerical adjustment of robot hand to correct the error.
    -(4.2) Point out potential errors that cause the failure. For example, robot control error or observation error.
    -(4.3) You can write equation to help calculate the better 'change of goal'. It should have same dimension with 'goal'.
    -(4.4) Report the result as a dictionary in triple backtics:
    ```
    {{
        'change of goal': [], (# a list that has same dimension with 'goal'. If success=Ture, report empty []. do not show content in the bracket)
    }}
    ```
